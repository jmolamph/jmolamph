### Hi! I'm James, Software Engineer and UX Designer. I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from UC Irvine in 2022.

I believe that *software is a solution*; designed and developed in order to help solve peoples' problems. I am passionate about user experience, human-centered design, machine learning, and any related topics! Always open to step out of my comfort zone, learn, and be exposed to new things!
